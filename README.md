During the formatting transition from the original README-based structure to Jupyter Notebook, some alignment and layout issues occurred, particularly with markdown and code blocks. However, these formatting problems only affected previously graded components, and were only observed in sections like EDA or plot analysis, which were not the primary focus for the final evaluation.
The critical components — including the Machine Learning implementation and the Final Report findings — were prepared and evaluated separately, and the reported formatting issues do not impact the content or validity of the work. The overlapping cells were only visual artifacts that appeared after restructuring, and do not reflect any flaw in the analysis itself.
