## **Project Overview**  
This project aims to analyze worker performance data at Teknosan Machining Co. using various data analyzing techniques. The objective is to explore how worker experience levels correlate with productivity and defect rates through visual representations. The project will involve data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and graphical interpretations to present meaningful insights.

## **Data Sources**  
### **Dataset: Worker Performance Data**  
- Collected from Teknosan Machining Co.  
- Contains variables such as:  
  - Worker ID  
  - Shift Type (Day/Night)  
  - Work Hours  
  - Productivity Metrics (Parts Produced, Defect Rates)  
  - Machine Usage
  - Experience Level (Years of Work Experience) 
    

This dataset will be analyzed and visualized to identify trends and patterns in relation to worker experience.

## **Research Question & Hypothesis**  
### **Hypothesis: The Impact of Worker Experience on Defect Rates**  
**H₀ (Null Hypothesis):** Worker experience has no significant impact on defect rates.  
**H₁ (Alternative Hypothesis):** More experienced workers produce fewer defects.

## **Analysis Plan**  
### **1. Data Collection & Cleaning **  
- Verify data completeness and consistency  
- Handle missing values & outliers  

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualization**  
- Visualize trends in worker experience vs. defect rates  
- Generate scatter plots, histograms, and bar charts  
- Create heatmaps and correlation matrices to explore relationships  

### **3. Hypothesis Testing **
